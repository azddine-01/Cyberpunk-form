# Cyberpunk-form

A neon, cyberpunk-styled HTML/CSS form UI template. This repository contains a small, static form built with HTML and CSS that demonstrates a retro-futuristic, neon-styled design suitable for landing pages, sign-up forms, or UI experiments.

Languages
- CSS
- HTML

Features
- Neon/cyberpunk visual style using CSS gradients, glassmorphism and glows
- Responsive layout for common form sizes
- Easy-to-customize variables for colors and spacing

Quick start
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/azddine-01/Cyberpunk-form.git
2. Open the form in your browser:
   - Open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

Usage
- The project is static — no build tools required. Edit the HTML and CSS files to change content and styles.
- Recommended workflow: use a live-reload extension or a simple static server (e.g., `python -m http.server`) when developing.

Customization
- Colors and glow settings are centralized in the main CSS file. Look for CSS variables (e.g., --accent-color, --bg-gradient) at the top of the stylesheet and adjust them to change the theme quickly.
- Form layout and spacing can be adjusted by editing container width, padding, and font-size rules.
